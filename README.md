Our interactive quiz feature tests your memory skills by asking your questions about your peers. Navigate to the Quiz page using the link in the nav bar to play our game and learn about your peers.
On the Quiz page, a random name from your network will appear. Enter this person’s cohort, hometown, past industry and goal industry to see how much you can remember about this select individual.

Click on the Display Answer button to see all the correct answers for this person.
